	<title>Quicktags for Pull-Quotes readme</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>If you would like to have a "Pull-quotes" button in your post editor, I highly recommend Frank Bueltge's <strong><a href="http://bueltge.de/wp-addquicktags-de-plugin/120/">Add&nbsp;Quicktags&nbsp;plugin</a></strong>.  Go download that, and then import the settings file I have included in this folder (<strong>jspullquotes.wpaq</strong>).</p>
<p>The page is in German, but you can easily find the download link, and the Plugin itself has both German and English translations built-in.</p>
<p>It doesn't work directly in the Rich-text editor, but if you click over to the "Code" tab, the button will appear there.  Personally, I use this plugin for several other custom tags I use regularly -- such as for post footnotes and foreign language &lt;span&gt;s.  It's very handy.  Thanks Frank!  :)</p>
<p>I eventually hope to integrate Quicktags directly into my Pull-quotes plugin, but even then I will probably continue to use this Quicktags plugin.  </p>
