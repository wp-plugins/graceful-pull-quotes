<h1>How to use a localization file</h1>

<p>This plugin can use localization files ending in <code>.mo</code> to translate its text into different languages.  Each language file is named with a code indicating the lanugage and country.  For example, a file for English as spoken in the USA would be "<code>jspq-en_US.mo</code>", and for Italian (as spoken in Italy) is "<code>jspq-it_IT.mo</code>".</p>

<p>To use a language other than the default English, take the <code>.mo</code> file you want and move it up to the base <code>jspullquotes</code> directory.</p>

<p>WordPress also needs to be set up properly for your language, of course.  For more information on doing this, please visit <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Localization">http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Localization</a>.</p>

<h1>How to submit a translation</h1>

<p>If you speak another language and would like to submit a translation of this plugin, please take a look at the file <code>jspq.pot</code>.  That's a template containing all the text that needs to be translated.  Rename it, adding the <code>language_COUNTRY</code> code as described above, and change the extension from "<code>.pot</code>" to "<code>.po</code>".</p>

<p>I highly recommend a program called <a href="http://www.poedit.net/">Poedit</a> for editing this file, but you can also do the translation manually using any text editor (see below).  Poedit is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and *nix systems.  You can get it at <a href="http://www.poedit.net/">http://www.poedit.net/</a>.  If using Poedit, be sure to open up <code>Settings...</code> under the <code>Catalog</code> menu and give yourself credit!

<p>If you're feeling ambitious, you might also translate the "alternate text" help file.  Simply open the file at <code>jspullquotes/files/help/alt-text-info.en_US.htm</code> in a text editor and translate it.  Rename it to <code>alt-text-info.language_COUNTRY.htm</code>.</p>

<p>When you're done, please email the file to me at  <a href="mailto:localizations@striderweb.com">localizations@striderweb.com</a>.  Note: you are emailing me a <code>.po</code> file.  I will convert it to a <code>.mo</code> file.</p>

<h2>Editing a .po file with a text editor</h2>

<p>It easy.  Every time you see something like this...</p>

<pre>
#: jspquote.class.php:123
msgid "Basic Options"
msgstr ""
</pre>

<p>...just fill in the blanks...</p>

<pre>
#: jspquote.class.php:123
msgid "Basic Options"
msgstr "Opzioni Di Base"
</pre>

<p>...and email it to me at <a href="mailto:localizations@striderweb.com">localizations@striderweb.com</a>.</p>

<p>Note that at the top of the file, you can give yourself credit where credit is due by replacing the CAPITALIZED TEXT with your own information.  Also, if you know it, please fill in the language code. (If you don't know the code, just tell me what language it is (and the country) in your email and I'll figure it out.)</p>
